/*
Review-only MySQL 8 SQL for one-row-per-user AEL output from production.

Important:
  - Requires MySQL 8+ because it uses CTEs and ROW_NUMBER().
  - The final SELECT returns one row per user.
  - subject_combos is NULL when the user has not completed at least one lesson.

Single-statement version. Edit filter values inside the params CTE.
Use CAST(NULL AS CHAR(36)) for no filter.

-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- PARAMS CTE — runtime filter injection
--
-- This CTE is the single control point for all query filters.
-- The Python runner replaces NULL values with real IDs before execution.
-- Leave all unused filters as NULL — the downstream CTEs handle NULL as
-- "no filter applied" (i.e. return all rows for that dimension).
--
-- How the Python runner injects values (run_production_users_by_centre.py):
--   Centre mode:  centre_id = <current centre UUID>,  user_id = NULL
--   User mode:    user_id   = <current user UUID>,    centre_id = NULL
--   All others remain NULL unless explicitly passed.
--
-- To test in a SQL client, replace NULL with a literal UUID, e.g.:
--   centre_id  → 'your-uuid-here'  (drop the CAST, paste the value directly)
